## COMPILER-RT ##

### WHAT IS COMPILER-RT? ###

Please see http://compiler-rt.llvm.org.

### INSTALLATION: ###

Ensure you have finished `build.sh`,

then run: `./build_compiler_rt.sh`.

By default, installation steps for compiler-rt will be printed to the terminal
to run manually, but you can automate the installation process by defining
`ENABLE_COMPILER_RT_INSTALL`.

You can verify compiler-rt is working by invoking the following command:

    echo "int main(void){return 0;}" | xcrun clang -xc -o/dev/null -v - 2>&1 | \
      grep "libclang_rt" 1>/dev/null && echo "Success"

If you see "Success", then everything went well.

### USAGE: ###

You do not need to do anything, clang's doing the job for you.

However, `-fsanitize=address` is a bit annoying because the address sanitizer library is linked  
dynamically, and thus requires you to copy the ASAN runtime library onto the target system. 

\[See [README.DEBUGGING](README.DEBUGGING.md) in how to get a backtrace with line numbers and symbol names]

The following example illustrates how to achieve this:

    # Example source code.
    $ cat test.c
    #include <stdlib.h>
    #include <string.h>
    #include <stdio.h>

    int main(void) {
      char buf[2];
      strcpy(buf, "Hello World"); /* Buffer overflow. */
      puts(buf);
      return 0;
    }

    # Compile the source file.
    $ o64-clang test.c -fsanitize=address -o test

    # Ensure the ASAN library is linked in.
    $ xcrun otool -L test
    test:
            /usr/lib/libstdc++.6.dylib (compatibility version 7.0.0, current version 104.1.0) # ASAN dep.
            @rpath/libclang_rt.asan_osx_dynamic.dylib (compatibility version 0.0.0, current version 0.0.0)
            /usr/lib/libSystem.B.dylib (compatibility version 1.0.0, current version 1213.0.0)

    # Copy 'test' and 'libclang_rt.asan_osx_dynamic.dylib' onto the target system.

    # You can find the ASAN library path easily with this one-liner:
    $ echo "int main(void){return 0;}" | xcrun clang -fsanitize=address -xc -o/dev/null -v - 2>&1 | \
      tr ' ' '\n' | grep libclang_rt.asan_osx_dynamic.dylib
    [...]/bin/../lib/clang/3.6.2/lib/darwin/libclang_rt.asan_osx_dynamic.dylib

    # Run ./test on the target system:
    $ DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH=. ./test
